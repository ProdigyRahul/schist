# Versioning and branching

## Versions

Schist uses semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) across the whole
workspace — every crate shares one version, set in the root `Cargo.toml`.

Two surfaces carry compatibility promises:

* **The plugin ABI** (`schist-plugin-host-wasm::abi::ABI_VERSION`) is
  versioned independently and changes rarely. Additive changes (new optional
  exports) keep the number; anything that would break an existing plugin
  bumps it, and the host then refuses older plugins with a clear message
  rather than mis-executing them.
* **PSD round-tripping.** Files written by any version must open in any
  later version. Blocks we don't interpret are preserved verbatim, so this
  holds even as new features land.

Before 1.0, minor versions may break internal Rust APIs between crates;
they will not break the plugin ABI or saved files.

## Branches

* `main` is always releasable: CI (fmt, clippy with `-D warnings`, the full
  test suite on Linux/macOS/Windows) must be green.
* Feature work happens on branches and merges via pull request.
* Releases are cut by tagging `vX.Y.Z` on `main`, which triggers
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` to build and attach installers.

## Updating

Schist checks GitHub for the latest release from Check for Updates —
under File, or the application menu on macOS — and once a day at launch while the "Check for new releases at
launch" preference is on (it is on by default; turning it off stops every
unattended request). The check sends nothing but the request, and a
download only starts when the user presses Update.

What happens next depends on the platform:

* **macOS** downloads `Schist.zip`, unpacks it beside the running bundle
  with `ditto`, and swaps it in with a rename. The new bundle is refused
  unless it is signed at least as well as the one it replaces: a signed
  copy only takes an update signed by the same team, and a signature that
  fails `codesign --verify --strict` is never installed. A relauncher
  waits for the editor to exit and opens the new bundle.
* **Windows** downloads `Schist-<version>-setup.exe` and hands it to a
  detached process that waits for the editor to exit — a running
  `schist.exe` cannot be overwritten — then runs it silently (`/S`,
  elevated, which is one UAC prompt) and starts the result. The installer
  is unsigned for now, so the download is only as good as its HTTPS
  connection and the SHA-256 GitHub records for the asset, which is
  checked when present.
* **Linux** installs nothing itself. A copy from `pacman`, `apt`, `dnf` or
  an AppImage belongs to whatever put it there, so the dialog names the
  new version and links to the release.

Self-updating only offers itself where the copy is one Schist may
replace: inside a writable `.app` bundle on macOS, and next to the
`uninstall.exe` the installer writes on Windows. A loose `schist.exe` or a
`cargo run` build is left alone.

The updater picks its download out of the release by asset name —
`Schist.zip` and `Schist-<version>-setup.exe`, matched in
`crates/app/src/update.rs`. Renaming either in `release.yml` without
changing it there ends self-updating silently, so keep the two together.

## Releasing

1. Update the version in the root `Cargo.toml`, `packaging/macos/Info.plist`
   and both `packaging/macos/quicklook/*-Info.plist` (an app extension
   carries its own version, and macOS re-registers one whose version
   moved).
2. `cargo test --workspace` and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.
3. Tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z" && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
4. The release workflow builds, for x86_64 and aarch64, a Linux AppImage
   plus the native packages `packaging/linux/packages.sh` emits (`.deb`,
   `.rpm` and a binary `.pkg.tar.zst` — the last one is a convenience
   build, not the source-built AUR package from step 6, though it is the
   payload the `schist-bin` AUR package there re-wraps), a macOS `Schist.dmg` and
   `Schist.zip` (both signed and notarized when the secrets below exist
   — the disk image is the one to point people at, the zip is for
   anything that unpacks a download itself), and a Windows installer,
   then drafts the release. Each
   platform also ships the `schist-mcp` server from the same build: a
   loose arch-suffixed binary on Linux (`schist-mcp-linux-x86_64`,
   `schist-mcp-linux-aarch64`), a loose binary on Windows, and on macOS
   `schist-mcp-macos.zip`, signed and notarized on its own. See
   [mcp.md](mcp.md).
5. When the Sentry settings below are present, the same workflow uploads
   each platform's debug info and registers the release. Nothing about the
   published artifacts changes either way.
6. Update the two AUR packages under `packaging/linux/aur/`. The loop is
   the same for both: bump `pkgver` to the new version, reset `pkgrel=1`,
   then in an Arch environment run `updpkgsums` (re-pins the sources'
   sha256s), test with `makepkg -s` + `namcap`, and regenerate `.SRCINFO`
   with `makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO` — the AUR rejects pushes
   without a current one. Commit `PKGBUILD` + `.SRCINFO` to each
   package's AUR remote (`ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/schist.git` and
   `…/schist-bin.git`) and mirror the `PKGBUILD` changes back here.

   * `schist/PKGBUILD` builds from the tag tarball, so it can go as soon
     as the tag is pushed. It keeps `options=(!lto)` (makepkg's
     `-flto=auto` breaks `ring`'s C objects under the clang link) and
     `clang`/`mold` in `makedepends` for the linker settings in
     `.cargo/config.toml` — don't drop either when touching it.
   * `schist-bin/PKGBUILD` re-wraps the `.pkg.tar.zst` release assets, so
     its `updpkgsums` only works once step 4's draft is published. Its
     `_relver` mirrors the `release=` in `packages.sh` (part of the asset
     name), and its dependency lists have to stay in step with that
     script's — which in turn mirror `schist/PKGBUILD`'s.

Unsigned builds are still produced when signing credentials are absent, so
forks and local builds work without secrets.

## Signing secrets

macOS signing and notarization are driven entirely by repository secrets.
Set all five and tagged builds come out notarized and stapled; leave them
unset and the same workflow produces an unsigned bundle.

| Secret | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `MACOS_CERT_P12_BASE64` | The *Developer ID Application* certificate and its private key, exported from Keychain Access as a `.p12` and then `base64 -i cert.p12 \| pbcopy`. |
| `MACOS_CERT_P12_PASSWORD` | The password set on that `.p12` during export. |
| `APPLE_ID` | The Apple ID of an account on the developer team. |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | An app-specific password for that Apple ID, from appleid.apple.com — not the account password. |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | The ten-character team ID, the part in brackets in the certificate's name. |

The workflow imports the certificate into a keychain it creates in
`$RUNNER_TEMP` and throws away with the runner, so it never touches the
login keychain. `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` may be set to pin that keychain's
password; otherwise the job generates a random one, which is all it needs
since nothing outside the job ever unlocks it.

The identity name is read back out of the imported certificate rather than
configured, so renewing the certificate means replacing two secrets and
nothing else.

Signing runs under the hardened runtime, which notarization requires. That
in turn requires both entitlements in
[`packaging/macos/entitlements.plist`](../packaging/macos/entitlements.plist).
The JIT one: the plugin host compiles every plugin with Cranelift at load
time, and without it a notarized build dies as soon as it loads one. And
library validation off: HEIC import dlopen's libheif — Homebrew's, or the
decode-only build the app offers to download — and the hardened runtime
otherwise refuses to load any library not signed by this Team ID, which no
copy of libheif is.

Windows builds are not signed — there is no certificate for them yet, so
the installer triggers SmartScreen on first download.

## Crash reporting and symbols

Schist can upload a crash to Sentry. It is off twice over: the user has to
tick **Preferences ▸ Diagnostics ▸ Also send it to the developers**, *and*
the build has to have been given a DSN. Only the release workflow supplies
one, so a build from source — or from a distribution's packaging — has no
DSN, never starts the SDK, and does not even show the checkbox. See
`crates/app/src/crash.rs`.

Events are scrubbed before they leave: no PII, no breadcrumbs, no session
tracking, `server_name` set to `redacted` rather than the machine's
hostname, and the user's home directory rewritten to `~` in the panic
message — an image editor panic tends to quote the path it choked on, and
that path is somebody's document.

### Settings

| Name | Kind | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | secret | A token with `project:releases`. It is the switch for all of this: without it every Sentry step is skipped and the release is built exactly as it was before. |
| `SCHIST_SENTRY_DSN` | secret | The DSN compiled into the app. Not really secret — it ships inside the binary — but it lives here so forks get an empty one and produce a build that cannot report. |
| `SENTRY_ORG` | variable | The organisation slug. |
| `SENTRY_PROJECT` | variable | The project slug. |

The two slugs are repository *variables*, not secrets: they are not
sensitive, and as secrets they would be masked out of exactly the log lines
that explain a failed upload.

### Debug info

The release profile builds with `debug = 1`, and each platform hands that
to Sentry in the form its object format keeps it in:

* **Linux** — DWARF lives inside the executable, and the workflow strips it
  before packaging so the AppImage does not carry it. The upload therefore
  happens *before* the strip, on the unstripped binary. What ships keeps its
  build id, and that is what Sentry matches the upload against; both Linux
  targets pin `--build-id=sha1` in `.cargo/config.toml`, since mold writes
  one by default and Ubuntu's GNU ld does not.
* **macOS** — the debug info stays in the object files, so `dsymutil`
  gathers it into a `.dSYM` and that is uploaded. It runs after packaging,
  because `bundle.sh` invokes cargo again and a relink there would change
  the binary's `LC_UUID`. Code signing is harmless: it appends a signature
  and leaves `LC_UUID` alone.
* **Windows** — MSVC writes a `.pdb` beside the executable. Nothing is
  stripped and the `.pdb` is uploaded as it is.

All three upload with `--include-sources`, which bundles the source the
debug info points at so stack frames come back with code beside them. The
sources are this repository and public crates, so there is nothing in that
bundle that is not already published.

A tagged build also registers `schist@X.Y.Z` as a Sentry release, which is
the name `crash.rs` reports under. Attaching the commit range to it needs a
repository integration configured on the Sentry side; without one that step
alone is skipped and the release is still created.
