# Versioning and branching

## Versions

Schist uses semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`) across the whole
workspace — every crate shares one version, set in the root `Cargo.toml`.

Two surfaces carry compatibility promises:

* **The plugin ABI** (`schist-plugin-host-wasm::abi::ABI_VERSION`) is
  versioned independently and changes rarely. Additive changes (new optional
  exports) keep the number; anything that would break an existing plugin
  bumps it, and the host then refuses older plugins with a clear message
  rather than mis-executing them.
* **PSD round-tripping.** Files written by any version must open in any
  later version. Blocks we don't interpret are preserved verbatim, so this
  holds even as new features land.

Before 1.0, minor versions may break internal Rust APIs between crates;
they will not break the plugin ABI or saved files.

## Branches

* `main` is always releasable: CI (fmt, clippy with `-D warnings`, the full
  test suite on Linux/macOS/Windows) must be green.
* Feature work happens on branches and merges via pull request.
* Releases are cut by tagging `vX.Y.Z` on `main`, which triggers
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` to build and attach installers.

## Releasing

1. Update the version in the root `Cargo.toml` and `packaging/macos/Info.plist`.
2. `cargo test --workspace` and `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`.
3. Tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z" && git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
4. The release workflow builds Linux AppImages for x86_64 and aarch64, a
   macOS `Schist.zip` (signed and notarized when the secrets below
   exist), and a Windows installer, then drafts the release. Each
   platform also ships the `schist-mcp` server from the same build: a
   loose arch-suffixed binary on Linux (`schist-mcp-linux-x86_64`,
   `schist-mcp-linux-aarch64`), a loose binary on Windows, and on macOS
   `schist-mcp-macos.zip`, signed and notarized on its own. See
   [mcp.md](mcp.md).
5. Update the AUR package from `packaging/linux/aur/PKGBUILD`: bump
   `pkgver` to the new version, reset `pkgrel=1`, then in an Arch
   environment run `updpkgsums` (re-pins the tag tarball's sha256), test
   with `makepkg -s` + `namcap`, and regenerate `.SRCINFO` with
   `makepkg --printsrcinfo > .SRCINFO` — the AUR rejects pushes without
   a current one. Commit `PKGBUILD` + `.SRCINFO` to the AUR remote
   (`ssh://aur@aur.archlinux.org/schist.git`) and mirror the `PKGBUILD`
   change back here. The PKGBUILD keeps `options=(!lto)` (makepkg's
   `-flto=auto` breaks `ring`'s C objects under the clang link) and
   `clang`/`mold` in `makedepends` for the linker settings in
   `.cargo/config.toml` — don't drop either when touching it.

Unsigned builds are still produced when signing credentials are absent, so
forks and local builds work without secrets.

## Signing secrets

macOS signing and notarization are driven entirely by repository secrets.
Set all five and tagged builds come out notarized and stapled; leave them
unset and the same workflow produces an unsigned bundle.

| Secret | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `MACOS_CERT_P12_BASE64` | The *Developer ID Application* certificate and its private key, exported from Keychain Access as a `.p12` and then `base64 -i cert.p12 \| pbcopy`. |
| `MACOS_CERT_P12_PASSWORD` | The password set on that `.p12` during export. |
| `APPLE_ID` | The Apple ID of an account on the developer team. |
| `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD` | An app-specific password for that Apple ID, from appleid.apple.com — not the account password. |
| `APPLE_TEAM_ID` | The ten-character team ID, the part in brackets in the certificate's name. |

The workflow imports the certificate into a keychain it creates in
`$RUNNER_TEMP` and throws away with the runner, so it never touches the
login keychain. `KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` may be set to pin that keychain's
password; otherwise the job generates a random one, which is all it needs
since nothing outside the job ever unlocks it.

The identity name is read back out of the imported certificate rather than
configured, so renewing the certificate means replacing two secrets and
nothing else.

Signing runs under the hardened runtime, which notarization requires. That
in turn requires the JIT entitlement in
[`packaging/macos/entitlements.plist`](../packaging/macos/entitlements.plist):
the plugin host compiles every plugin with Cranelift at load time, and
without that entitlement a notarized build dies as soon as it loads one.

Windows builds are not signed — there is no certificate for them yet, so
the installer triggers SmartScreen on first download.
