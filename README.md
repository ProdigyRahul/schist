# Schist

A layered image editor written in Rust on [GPUI], with first-class PSD
support and a plugin-first architecture — every tool, filter, format and
menu command is a plugin, including the built-in ones.

[GPUI]: https://gpui.rs

**Status: v1 feature-complete,
plus two Photoshop-parity passes — 55 tools, 57 filters, 16 adjustments,
all nine layer effects, and live vector shapes.** 540 tests,
clippy-clean, verified end-to-end under a real window. [What is still
missing](#not-there-yet) is a short list now.

## Build and run

```sh
# Linux needs GPUI's system dependencies:
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libfontconfig-dev \
  libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-x11-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-render0-dev \
  libxcb-shape0-dev libxcb-xfixes0-dev libvulkan-dev clang

cargo run --release -p schist-app -- [file.psd|file.png|…]
```

`cargo test --workspace` runs everything. Packaging scripts for macOS,
Windows and Linux live in [packaging/](packaging); tagging `vX.Y.Z` builds
them all in CI, signing and notarizing the macOS bundle when the
[signing secrets](docs/versioning.md#signing-secrets) are set. All three
register `.psd`, `.psb`, `.afphoto`, `.afdesign`, `.afpub` and `.af` as
openable, never as the default handler: an installed Schist joins the
"Open with" menu rather than taking files off Photoshop or Affinity.

The logo is generated, not drawn: [`tools/logo.py`](tools/logo.py) holds the
geometry and `python3 tools/logo.py` re-emits the SVGs and every `.icns`,
`.ico` and `.png` the packaging needs. Edit the constants at the top of that
file, never its output.

## What it does

**Documents.** PSD and PSB read *and* write — layers, nested groups, masks,
all 27 blend modes, adjustment layers, layer effects, vector shapes,
8/16/32-bit, RGB, greyscale, CMYK, Lab and Indexed, RLE and zip-compressed
channels. Every block Schist doesn't understand is preserved
byte-for-byte, so a round trip never loses work. **Smart objects** keep
their source pixels, so transforming one repeatedly costs no more quality
than transforming it once. Also PNG, JPEG, WebP and TIFF, plus HEIC/HEIF import (iPhone photos).
HEIC decodes through libheif loaded at runtime: the system's copy if
installed, otherwise Schist offers to download a hash-pinned,
decode-only build (with its LGPL license texts) from
[libheif-prebuilt](https://github.com/IAmJSD/libheif-prebuilt) — nothing
links at build time and the build stays pure Rust. Affinity files
(`.af`/`.afphoto`/`.afdesign`/`.afpub` — Affinity 1, 2 and the unified Canva-era format) open through a
natively reverse-engineered reader
([docs/affinity-format.md](docs/affinity-format.md)): pixel layers,
placed images, groups, masks, live shapes, free paths, editable text
(set in the document's real fonts, GPOS kerning and all), layer
effects — on groups too — and sixteen adjustment types come in as
real layers, each verified against renders and exports from Affinity
itself; whatever Affinity would re-render live and we can't rebuild
yet is covered by the file's embedded flattened preview, imported as
a hidden reference layer or, when nothing else survives, as the
document itself. Export writes layered `.af` documents back (unified
version-12 container): rasters as native tiles, groups, masks,
clipping, blend modes, drop shadows / glows / outlines / colour
overlays, and adjustment layers round-tripped from their preserved
native parameters — the writer's object graphs re-serialize every
fixture and corpus document byte-for-byte, so the on-disk shapes are
exactly what Affinity itself writes. Text and vector layers export as
pixels for now.

**Selecting.** Rectangular and elliptical marquee; free, polygonal and
magnetic lassos; magic wand with tolerance and contiguity; quick selection
that grows to match what you paint over; object selection that finds a
subject inside a drawn box. Then Modify (expand, contract, border, smooth,
feather), Grow, Similar, Colour Range, and save/load. Marching ants trace
the selection's real boundary — holes and all.

**Painting and retouching.** Brush, pencil, eraser, background eraser,
magic eraser, clone stamp, history brush, gradient, paint bucket,
dodge/burn/sponge, blur, sharpen, smudge; spot healing and healing brushes,
patch, content-aware move and red eye. Healing takes texture from the
source and colour from around the edge, so patching a blemish gives you
skin rather than a blurred blemish.

**Vector.** Pen, freeform pen and curvature pen draw paths that are
*stored*, so Path Selection and Direct Selection can edit them and Layer ▸
Path can fill, stroke or convert them to a selection. Rectangle, ellipse,
line (with its own weight, 45° constrain and arrowheads), polygon and six
custom shapes — as **live shape layers** by default, which keep their
path, regenerate their pixels from it, and survive a PSD round trip as
vectors. Editable text layers.

**Non-destructive.** Sixteen adjustments — levels, curves, hue/saturation,
brightness/contrast, black & white, colour balance, vibrance, exposure,
photo filter, gradient map, selective colour, channel mixer, invert,
posterize, threshold, solid colour — as layers, or applied straight to the
pixels from Image ▸ Adjustments. Layer masks, clipping masks, group
isolation, per-layer blend mode and opacity.

**Layer effects.** All nine: bevel & emboss, stroke, inner shadow, inner
glow, satin, colour overlay, gradient overlay, outer glow and drop shadow,
with Photoshop's Fill-vs-Opacity semantics so "Fill 0% plus a drop shadow"
does what you expect.

**Filters.** Fifty-seven across ten categories — Blur, Distort, Noise,
Pixelate, Render, Sharpen, Stylize, Other, Camera Raw and Neural Filters
— all previewing live on the canvas inside the selection, with Cancel
restoring exactly. The **Filter Gallery** stacks several and previews the
result of the lot.

**Warping.** Liquify with all seven brushes, Puppet Warp (Moving Least
Squares, so pins hold and nothing shears), Content-Aware Scale (seam
carving, with the selection as the protect mask), and Vanishing Point,
which clones along a perspective plane so the copy foreshortens with the
surface.

**Document furniture.** Artboards and slices, each exportable to its own
file; frames that clip their contents; notes; the Count tool; and layer
comps that capture every layer's visibility and appearance under a name.

**Colour.** ICC profiles honoured on open, assign vs. convert as separate
operations, a document→display transform, soft proofing, and ordered
dithering when exporting to 8-bit.

**GPU.** Compositing runs on the GPU when an adapter exists: the layer
tree — blend modes, masks, clipping, group isolation, all sixteen
adjustment kinds — compiles to a compute-shader program (wgpu), and
zooming, rotating and panning resample on the GPU too, which is what keeps
large documents responsive. The big filter sweeps go the same way: the box
passes behind every Gaussian, the lens blur's disc, and the displacement
resample Liquify and Puppet Warp re-run on every pointer move — the
operations that cross the whole selection per keystroke of a dialog, where
a lens blur at radius 60 is eleven thousand taps a pixel. **Content-Aware
Scale** runs there too, and runs *entirely* there: find the lowest-energy
seam, cut it, start again is hundreds of full-image passes for one
command, so the whole loop stays on the device and only the finished image
comes back. The CPU is the semantic reference throughout: parity tests
hold the GPU to it, anything it can't express (layers mid-drag) or can't
fit falls back for that call, and machines with no usable adapter just run
the CPU path. Toggle it in
Preferences, or override with `SCHIST_GPU=0` / `SCHIST_GPU=1`.

**Image.** Mode (RGB, greyscale, CMYK, Lab, Indexed), Auto Tone /
Contrast / Colour, image and canvas size, the five rotations and flips,
crop and trim.

**Editor.** Rotate View, rulers with drag-out guides, grid and snapping,
screen modes,
light/dark themes, navigator, history with click-to-jump, unlimited undo,
crash recovery, and a fully remappable keymap. Right-click the layers,
history, colour or navigator panels — or the canvas — for Photoshop-style
context menus (layer properties, duplicate, clipping mask, reorder, merge…).

## Mouse and touchpad

Two-finger scroll pans; **Ctrl/⌘/Alt + scroll zooms** toward the pointer.
Prefer it the other way round? **Preferences ▸ Zoom with scroll wheel**
swaps them, so plain scrolling zooms and the modifier pans.

**Pinch-to-zoom** works on macOS, Linux — Wayland, and X11 on
xorg-server 21.1+ (XI 2.4) — and Windows touchscreens, zooming about the
centre of the gesture, and **stylus pressure** drives brush size on all
four backends. Upstream GPUI surfaces neither, so both come from a fork —
[IAmJSD/gpui](https://github.com/IAmJSD/gpui), which adds `PinchEvent`,
`on_pinch` and a `pressure` field on the mouse events on top of
gpui 0.2.2 — pinned by revision in the workspace `Cargo.toml`.

The one pinch gap left is Windows precision touchpads, and it is a gap by
choice. Windows delivers their pinches as Ctrl+scroll rather than as a
gesture — which is already a zoom here anyway — and the only way to see
the real gesture is Direct Manipulation, which cannot be claimed for
pinches alone: the same claim covers two-finger pans and takes over
scrolling with them. The fork implements it, behind
`GPUI_ENABLE_DIRECT_MANIPULATION=1`, but it is untested on hardware and
off by default rather than put in the path of ordinary scrolling. On a
pre-21.1 X11 server there is no pinch at all. Ctrl+scroll, the
zoom-with-scroll preference, ⌘+/⌘-, and the navigator's zoom slider work
everywhere.

Remap anything in `~/.config/schist/keymap.json`:

```json
{ "ctrl-shift-x": "command:edit.fill_foreground", "f1": "tool:brush" }
```

## Not there yet

- **Tablet pressure has never met a tablet.** The pipeline carries
  pressure end to end and all four backends now feed it — macOS
  (`NSEvent`), X11 (the XInput2 pressure valuator), Windows (pen pointer
  messages) and Wayland (`zwp_tablet_v2`) — but every one of those paths
  was written against the platform documentation rather than a physical
  stylus. Wayland is the one to be most suspicious of: tablet input there
  is a protocol of its own rather than an axis on the pointer, so binding
  it means synthesising the whole mouse event stream from the tool, tip
  and barrel buttons included. Reports from real hardware welcome.
- **Only two Neural Filters run a network.** Super Zoom uses a small
  residual CNN trained for this application (`tools/train/detail.py`,
  39k parameters and 153 KB, shipped in the binary); Style Transfer uses
  the fast neural-style networks from the ONNX Model Zoo, downloaded on demand
  from Filter ▸ Neural Filters ▸ Manage Models. Inference is
  [`tract`](https://github.com/sonos/tract) — pure Rust, nothing to
  install. The rest are signal processing: Skin Smoothing does not know
  what a face is, it does frequency separation on pixels whose colour
  falls in the skin-tone range. Each filter says in its own dialog which
  path it took, and the model-backed ones fall back to the classical one
  rather than failing.
- **Object Selection and Content-Aware Fill are heuristics**, not the
  models Photoshop uses — background sampling and diffusion inpainting
  respectively. They degrade predictably (blurry over texture) rather
  than mysteriously.
- **CMYK and Lab edit in RGB.** Files open, edit and save in their own
  mode, converting at the boundaries; the editing in between is RGB, so
  individual ink channels are not separately editable.
- **Text is not on a path**, and the type engine has no OpenType
  feature controls.
- **The mesh warp and the carve need the layer to fit one storage
  binding.** A displacement may read anywhere in its source, and every
  seam depends on the one before it over the whole image, so neither can
  be split into bands the way the blurs are; on adapters at the 128 MB
  baseline a large layer falls back to the CPU. Real GPUs report bindings
  in the gigabytes and never reach it. The carve also stays on the CPU
  below a couple of megapixels, where its row-by-row scan costs more in
  dispatches than it saves.

## Plugins

Third-party plugins are sandboxed WebAssembly — no filesystem, network or
clock, and a fuel budget so a runaway plugin can't hang the editor. A filter
is one function:

```rust
schist_filter! {
    id: "com.example.sepia",
    name: "Sepia",
    category: "Plugins",
    params: [param("amount", "Amount", 0.0, 100.0, 100.0, "%")],
    apply: |pixels: &mut [f32], _w: usize, _h: usize, params: &Params| { /* … */ }
}
```

Drop the `.wasm` in `~/.config/schist/plugins/` — or use **File ▸
Plugins…**, which also shows why anything failed to load. Full instructions
and a format example: [docs/plugin-guide.md](docs/plugin-guide.md).

## MCP

`schist-mcp` is a [Model Context
Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that drives Schist
headless — sessions instead of windows, with every tool, command, filter
and codec reachable through the same registry the app uses, plus inline
PNG rendering. It ships with every release; `cargo build --release -p
schist-mcp` builds it from source. See [docs/mcp.md](docs/mcp.md).
