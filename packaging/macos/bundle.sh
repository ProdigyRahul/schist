# and the standalone schist-mcp server, signing and notarizing both when
# credentials are present. Always leaves three
# distributables:
#   dist/Schist.dmg            the app, in a window to drag into /Applications
#   dist/Schist.zip            the app bundle
#   dist/schist-mcp-macos.zip  the MCP server, a plain CLI binary
# Only the disk image and the zips are safe to hand to CI artifact upload,
# which would otherwise strip permissions and symlinks and void the
# signatures.
#
# Signing is optional -- without it both still build, unsigned:
#   MACOS_CERT_NAME   "Developer ID Application: … (TEAMID)"
#   MACOS_KEYCHAIN    keychain holding that identity, if not the default one
#
# Notarizing needs signing to have happened, plus either
#   MACOS_NOTARY_PROFILE  a profile saved by `notarytool store-credentials`
# or the three pieces that profile would have stored:
#   APPLE_ID, APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD, APPLE_TEAM_ID
