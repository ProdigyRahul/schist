# What it does, and why it isn't just cargo:
#   1. cargo build for wasm32-unknown-unknown.
#   2. wasm-bindgen writes the JS glue and the processed module. The CLI
#      version must equal the crate's in Cargo.lock, so that's checked.
#   3. wasm-opt -Oz (when installed) shaves 10-20% off the module.
#   4. The module is SPLIT into fixed-size chunks. One ~20 MB .wasm
#      downloads as a single opaque stall; chunks download over parallel
#      connections and give the loading page a byte-accurate bar. The
#      loader reassembles them before instantiation.
#   5. Everything the native build embeds (icons, fonts) or carries in
#      the store (neural models) is copied out as plain files: the wasm
#      carries no assets at all. Icons and fonts are fetched by the
#      loading page; models are fetched by the app on demand.
#   6. manifest.json tells the loader what to fetch and how big it is.
#
# Serve dist/web/ from any static server over localhost or https (WebGPU
