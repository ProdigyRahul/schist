"""Fetch a photograph corpus for training the colourisation network.

A colouriser is only as good as the photographs it was shown, and the
photographs it was shown have to be ones anybody can fetch and nobody has
to ask about. Open Images is exactly that: every image in it is licensed
CC BY 2.0 -- the list is checked here rather than assumed -- and the
index carries the author and the link back to the original, which are
written to `credits.csv` beside the download.

The index is Google's; the pictures themselves come from the Flickr CDN
that has always served them. What is fetched is the ~640-pixel preview
each entry carries, not the original: the network sees 256x256, and a
20-megapixel original would be four hundred times the download for
something that gets resampled away.

The validation split is used rather than the training one because it is
41,620 images in one 15 MB index instead of nine million in a gigabyte
of them, and nothing here needs nine million.

Usage:  python3 tools/train/photos.py --out <dir> --count 20000
