//! One picture of a document, rendered without a window.
//!
//! This is what a file browser wants: not the editable document, just
//! the image, at some size, soon. macOS Quick Look is the caller that
//! shaped it — it gives an extension seconds, and a layered 2 GB PSB
//! does not open in seconds — but nothing here is macOS-specific.
//!
//! Two ways to the same picture, cheapest first:
//!
//! 1. **The embedded preview.** Photoshop writes a JPEG thumbnail into
//!    an image resource; Affinity writes a PNG of the page into the
//!    container. Both are the writing app's own render, so when one is
//!    large enough for the size asked for, it is both the fastest and
//!    the most faithful answer available.
//! 2. **A real composite.** Otherwise the file opens through the same
//!    codecs and compositor the editor uses — layers, masks, blend
//!    modes, adjustment layers and layer effects included — and the
//!    result is scaled down in bands, so peak memory follows the
//!    requested size rather than the document's.
//!
//! A camera raw is the same shape: the JPEG the camera embedded, else
//! the developed sensor data. Everything else (PNG, JPEG, WebP, TIFF)
//! decodes and scales directly.
