//! Neural network inference: the Neural Filters, and the two tools that
//! need a model as much as any of them.
//!
//! Runs ONNX models through [`tract`], which is pure Rust -- no ONNX
//! Runtime, no C toolchain, nothing to install. That matters here: a paint
//! program that needs a 300 MB runtime and a matching CUDA to sharpen a
//! photo is not a paint program anyone will use.
//!
//! Two kinds of model:
//!
//! * **Built in.** `detail.onnx`, `dejpeg.onnx`, `colorize.onnx`,
//!   `portrait.onnx`, `inpaint.onnx` and the waifu2x upscalers ship
//!   inside the binary, a few megabytes between them -- ours were
//!   trained small on purpose (see `tools/train/`), and waifu2x's
//!   upconv_7 came small.
//! * **Downloaded.** The style-transfer, depth, face and segmentation
//!   networks are megabytes to tens of megabytes each and are somebody
//!   else's work, so they are fetched on demand into the user's data
//!   directory and checked against a known hash.
//!
//! And two ways of feeding one, which is what [`Input`] distinguishes: a
//! model that *changes* an image sees it in tiles at full resolution,
//! while a model that answers a question *about* an image -- where the
//! faces are, what is near -- sees the whole thing resampled into one
//! fixed frame.
//!
//! Every filter that uses a model also works without it, and so does
//! every tool. The classical implementation is not a stub -- it is the
//! fallback, and it is what runs when the model is missing, when it
//! fails, or when it looks at the picture and has nothing to say.
