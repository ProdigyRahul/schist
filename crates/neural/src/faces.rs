//! Face detection, for Skin Smoothing.
//!
//! UltraFace is a single-shot detector: it scores a few thousand fixed
//! boxes at once and hands back all of them, so the work here is choosing
//! which ones to believe. That is a confidence threshold and
//! non-maximum suppression -- keep the best box, drop everything that
//! overlaps it, repeat -- because a detector fires several times on one
//! face and a filter wants the face, not the firings.
//!
//! Boxes come back in the model's own frame, which the image was
//! letterboxed into; they are mapped back to image pixels here so nothing
//! downstream has to know that happened.
