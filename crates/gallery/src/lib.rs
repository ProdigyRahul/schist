//! The photo gallery's on-disk model, shared by the app and the headless
//! `schist-mcp` server.
//!
//! Everything the gallery persists is a file the user can look at:
//! `library.json` (watched folders, buckets, recents), the index
//! snapshot (`index.v1`: one row per photo — search embedding, EXIF
//! position and capture time, nearest city, content-filter verdict),
//! and the caches beside each thumbnail. The app builds and maintains
//! them; a headless server reads them to answer for the gallery when
//! the app is not running. Both go through here, so the formats have
//! one owner.

// The headless gallery searches with the text tower, which the neural
// crate does not build for the web — and no web build serves the
