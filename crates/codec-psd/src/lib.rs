//! PSD/PSB reader and writer for Schist.
//!
//! Scope: read the five PSD sections —
//! header, color mode data, image resources, layer & mask info, merged image
//! data — into a [`schist_core::Document`]. Everything we do not
//! interpret (unknown image resources, unknown additional-layer-info keys,
//! text engine data, smart objects, effects) is preserved verbatim on the
//! document / layers so the writer can round-trip it byte-for-byte.
//!
//! Supported: PSD (version 1) and PSB (version 2); 8/16/32-bit depth; RGB
//! and Grayscale color modes; raw and RLE (PackBits) channel compression;
//! groups (`lsct`), layer masks, unicode names (`luni`), adjustment layers.
//!
//! Deliberately deferred: zip/zip-with-prediction channel compression,
//! Bitmap/Indexed/CMYK/Lab/Duotone/Multichannel modes.
