//! The PATH the agent CLIs are looked up on.
//!
//! A GUI launch inherits launchd's (or the desktop session's) minimal
//! PATH, never the user's shell configuration, so a `claude` or `codex`
//! living in ~/.local/bin, /opt/homebrew/bin or an npm prefix looks
//! missing while working fine from a terminal. The fix is to ask the
//! user's login shell what its PATH is — but that is a whole shell
//! startup, rc files and all, and on a real dotfile setup it costs the
//! better part of a second. Nothing about opening a window should wait
//! for it, so the shell is asked on a thread and the answer collected
//! whenever it turns up: by the picker when it repaints ([`current`]),
//! and by a worker thread that is actually about to spawn a CLI
//! ([`resolved`], the only caller that waits).
//!
//! The answer is deliberately *not* published with `set_var`. By the time
//! it lands the app is many threads deep in GPUI, and editing the process
//! environment underneath them is unsound; it is handed to each spawn
//! explicitly instead — an absolute path for the CLI itself, a `PATH`
//! override for the children it goes on to spawn.
