//! The AI sidebar's plumbing: agent harnesses driven through their SDKs,
//! feeding a transcript, with the app's own MCP server as their hands.
//!
//! Two worker shapes, one contract. A conversation runs on its own thread
//! (Claude Code through the Claude Agent SDK on a small tokio runtime,
//! Codex through its app-server protocol client, synchronously) and talks
//! back exclusively through [`AiShared`]: agent events queue up for the
//! workspace's ticker to drain, and MCP requests queue up for the
//! workspace to answer against the live document. Nothing here touches
//! the UI or the document directly — the UI thread owns both.
