//! The photo gallery: watched folders, thumbnails, camera import, and
//! the PSD backing files behind gallery edits.
//!
//! Half Picasa, half Lightroom: folders are watched in place rather than
//! copied into a catalogue, and edits never touch the original file.
//! Opening a photo from the gallery gives the document a hidden sidecar
//! (`<folder>/.schist/<name>.psd`) as its save path, so ⌘S writes the
//! layered edit there — with the previous state copied into
//! `.schist/versions/` first — and the gallery thumbnails render from
//! the sidecar once one exists. Desktop only: a browser tab has no
//! folders to watch and no cameras to mount, so the whole module is
//! compiled out of the web build.
