//! to the recovery snapshots, and uploading that report to Sentry is a
//! second, separate opt-in — writing a file to this machine and sending one
//! to us are not the same decision. Update checks, the other thing here that
//! speaks to the network, live in [`crate::update`].
//!
//! The upload has a second lock on it. It needs a DSN, and a DSN is baked
//! in at build time from `SCHIST_SENTRY_DSN`, which only the release
//! workflow sets. A build from source has none, so the preference does not
//! even appear, and `sentry::init` is never reached.
