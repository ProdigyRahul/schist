//! The plug-in helper process.
//!
//! Schist never loads a `.8bf` itself. It writes the pixels into a file,
//! starts one of these, and waits. Three things follow, none of which
//! are available in process:
//!
//! * A plug-in fault kills the helper and nothing else. These are
//!   twenty-year-old binaries; they do fault.
//! * The helper is built for the *plug-in's* architecture, not Schist's,
//!   so an Intel filter runs on an Apple Silicon Mac and a Windows
//!   filter runs on Linux under Wine.
//! * Where an emulator is needed it wraps this process's command line
//!   and nothing else in Schist has to know.
//!
//! Usage: `schist-8bf-helper --port <n> --token <hex>`. The host listens
//! and this connects back, so the helper needs no address of its own.
