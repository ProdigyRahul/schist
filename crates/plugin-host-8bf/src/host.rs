//! Driving a filter plug-in: the selector sequence, `advanceState`, and
//! the marshalling between our pixels and the plug-in's view of them.
//!
//! The calling sequence is API Guide chapter 8's: `Parameters`,
//! `Prepare`, `Start`, then `Continue` for as long as the plug-in leaves
//! a non-empty rectangle behind, then `Finish`. A plug-in that uses
//! `advanceState` does all its work inside `Start` and never sees a
//! `Continue`; the same [`Session::advance`] serves both, because the
//! host-side work — commit the last output, hand over the next input —
//! is identical whichever side drives the loop.
