//! The Photoshop filter plug-in ABI: primitive types, the `FilterRecord`
//! parameter block, and the selector/mode/case constants.
//!
//! # Provenance
//!
//! Everything here was written from Adobe's *published prose* — the
//! "Adobe Photoshop API Guide" (version CS, October 2003) and the
//! "Cross-Application Plug-in Development Resource Guide" (version 1.6,
//! June 1999). No Adobe SDK header was read or transcribed. Where the
//! prose pins a fact down, the field or constant carries a `#[doc]`
//! pointing at the table it came from; where it does not, the item is
//! tagged `UNVERIFIED` and listed in `docs/8bf-abi-provenance.md`.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! `FilterRecord` is `#[repr(C, packed(4))]`, not naturally aligned.
//! The API Guide says packing "should be the default for the target
//! system", which sounds like natural alignment and is not: it was
//! written for 32-bit, where a pointer's default alignment *is* four
//! bytes. On 64-bit the SDK pins four rather than following the platform
//! to eight, and real plug-ins agree — they read `bufferProcs` at the
//! offset four-byte packing puts it at, which is how this was settled.
//! The field offsets are pinned by `tests/layout.rs` and cross-checked
//! against a C compiler's own `offsetof` by `tests/fixtures/probe.c`, so
//! a wrong assumption fails loudly instead of silently corrupting a
//! plug-in's view of the record.
//!
//! `int32`/`int16` are fixed-width in the SDK's own typedefs, so the
//! layout does not move between LP64 (Unix) and LLP64 (Windows). That is
//! what lets the whole record be exercised by a native ELF test plug-in
//! on Linux.
